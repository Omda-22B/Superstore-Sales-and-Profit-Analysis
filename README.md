# Superstore-Sales-and-Profit-Analysis
This project involves building interactive dashboards using Power BI to analyze sales, profit, and order data for a superstore from 2020 to 2023. The dashboards provide key insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and performance metrics across categories, regions, and time periods, helping decision-makers optimize their strategies.
